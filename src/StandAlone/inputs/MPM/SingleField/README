These are input examples for the SingleField MPM code, based on Homel's DFG method.

These assume the #define RIGID near the top of the SingleFieldMPM.cc is turned on.

Near line 3281 in that file is code that sets the velocity for material 0, which
behaves as a rigid material in those cases.  There are options for a foam compression test, a Brazil test and a two disk plate problem, as well as other examples.

Also, near the very end is an "#ifdef RIGID".  If you want material 0 to push
through other materials, that code is needed.  If you want material 0 to have
more of a frictional contact interaction, then comment out the code therein.
